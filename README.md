# Better Channeling

**Better Channeling** is a lightweight Fabric mod that enhances the Channeling enchantment by introducing multiple levels with distinct behaviors, while staying as close to vanilla gameplay as possible.

## ‚ú® Channeling Enchantment Levels:

1. **Channeling I** 
    - Behaves exactly like vanilla: tridents summon lightning **only during thunderstorms**.
2. **Channeling II**
    - Allows lightning strikes **during any rain**, not just thunderstorms.
    - **Rare**: Appears in about **5-6% of all Channeling enchantments** at level 30.
3. **Channeling III**
    - Enables lightning strikes **at any time**, regardless of weather.
    - **Not obtainable via enchanting table**. Can only be acquired by **combining Channeling II** tridents or books using an **anvil**.

2. **Install Fabric Loader**
    - Download and run the [Fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).

3. **Install Better Channeling**
   - Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your `mods` folder:
     - `~/.minecraft/mods` (or your instance folder if using a launcher like MultiMC or Prism)
   - If you don‚Äôt have a `mods` folder, launch Minecraft with Fabric once to generate it.
4. **Verify Installation**
   - Launch Minecraft with Fabric.
   - In a creative world:
      - Search for "Channeling" in the creative inventory.
      - You should see three enchanted books (Channeling I, II, III).

## üß™ Mod Compatibility

- Works in both **single-player** and **multiplayer**.
- When **installed on a Fabric server**, it should function correctly, **even if players do not have the mod installed client-side**.
- However, it is **recommended** that both **client and server have the mod installed** to ensure proper enchantment visibility (e.g., seeing Channeling II and III in creative menus or enchanting tables).
- Does **not** require the Fabric API.
- Should be compatible with **any mod that does not directly modify Trident or Channeling behavior**.
- If you discover an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](https://github.com/MaxTKB/BetterChanneling/issues) so it can be investigated and resolved if possible.
## üìö About the Mod

This mod uses Mixins to adjust the behavior of:
- The `TridentEntity` class
- The `ChannelingEnchantment` class

Its goal is to offer a more customizable and immersive enchantment experience without deviating from the core mechanics of the game.
